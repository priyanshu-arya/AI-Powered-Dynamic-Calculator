# üßÆ Smart Math Expression Calculator (AI-Powered-Dynamic-Calculator)

An intelligent mathematical expression calculator that combines the power of React, FastAPI, and Google's Gemini AI to solve various mathematical problems through image recognition. This full-stack application can handle everything from simple arithmetic to complex equations and even interpret mathematical concepts from drawings.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-Expression Recognition**: Process various types of mathematical expressions:
  - Basic arithmetic operations
  - Variable assignments
  - Systems of equations
  - Graphical math problems
  - Abstract mathematical concepts
- **Variable Management**: Store and reuse variables across calculations
- **Smart PEMDAS Implementation**: Follows standard order of operations
- **Modern React Frontend**: Built with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Powerful Backend**: FastAPI-based REST API with Google Gemini AI integration
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant feedback on calculations

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18.x
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Mantine UI
- ShadcnUI Components
- React Router DOM

### Backend
- FastAPI
- Google Generative AI (Gemini-1.5-flash)
- Python 3.x
- Pillow for image processing
- Uvicorn server

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python 3.8+
- Google Gemini API key
- npm or yarn package manager

## üöÄ Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/priyanshu/smart-math-calculator.git
cd smart-math-calculator
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8900
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

### Start the Backend Server
```bash
python main.py
```
The server will start at `http://localhost:8900`

### Start the Frontend Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## üîç How It Works

1. **Image Processing**:
   - Upload an image containing mathematical expressions
   - The image is converted to base64 and sent to the backend
   - Backend processes the image using Pillow

2. **AI Analysis**:
   - Google Gemini AI analyzes the image content
   - Identifies mathematical expressions and their context
   - Applies PEMDAS rules for calculations

3. **Response Processing**:
   - Results are formatted into structured JSON
   - Supports multiple expression types
   - Handles variable assignments and references

4. **Frontend Display**:
   - Real-time updates of calculations
   - Elegant UI with Mantine and ShadcnUI
   - Responsive design for all devices

## üìù API Endpoints

- `POST /calculate`: Process image and return mathematical results
  - Request Body: `ImageData` (image in base64 format and variables dictionary)
  - Response: Calculated results with expressions and answers

## üîê Security

- CORS middleware enabled
- API key validation for Gemini AI
- Input sanitization and validation
